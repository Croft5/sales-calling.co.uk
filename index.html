                        <p>The phone is a powerful and vital way for you to grow your business. What I offer is unique coaching and training for your staff who you need to be effective on the phone.</p>
                        <p>The three main steps are firstly to see if you have the right people; it's a demanding role, not right for many.</p>
                        <p>Next, to provide them with the tools and techniques they need.</p>
                        <p>Finally, and very importantly, to gift them the personal skills necessary to become great at prospecting and selling on the phone.</p>

                        <h3 id="method">Method</h3>
                        <p>Following an initial meeting on the phone, via video or in person, there would be a one day on-site session. This will allow me to get to know your business, staff, and processes.</p>
                        <p>We will then go over my findings so we understand what training is required. </p>
                        <p>Each session I would come on-site and spend the day with your callers, typically 10am to 4pm.</p>
                        <p>it's important staff have time between sessions to practice their new skills. One day a month for six months is a typical run for most businesses.</p>
