            <div>
                <h3 id="story">My Story</h3>
                <p>I'm Dave Edmonds, been in sales for over 40 years, most of that time using the telephone, well only that and post back in the 80's & 90's.</p>
                <p>The phone is still a powerful and vital way for you to grow your business. What I offer is a unique one to one coaching and training for your staff who need to be effective on the phone for you</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 id="method">Method</h3>
                <p>The three main steps are firstly to see if you have the right people; it's a demanding role, not right for many.</p>
                <p>Then to provide them with the tools and techniques.</p>
                <p>Finally, and very importantly, to gift them the personal skills necessary to become great at prospecting and selling over the phone.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>
                <p>Following an initial meeting, phone, video or in person, there would be an on-site one day session costing £250 so I can get to know your business, staff and processes.</p>
                <p>Once we have discussed my report you can decide how many one day sessions would be best; I find that one day a month for say six months is a good staring point.</p>
                <p>Each day I will come on-site and spend the day with one or two of your callers, typically 10am to 4pm. Each day is £250; it's important that they have time between sessions to practice their new skills.</p>
